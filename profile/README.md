Our Projects
------

We believe AI cannot solve all driving scenarios. NagasPilot branches into two projects:

- **[openpilot](https://github.com/nagaspilot/openpilot)**: Fork of DragonPilot Brother for Chinese car compatibility
- **[enhancedpilot](https://github.com/nagaspilot/enhancedpilot)**: Hybrid rewrite combining rule-based stereo vision with AI-assisted decision making
- **[brownpanda](https://github.com/nagaspilot/brownpanda)**: Automotive gateway hardware enabling universal vehicle compatibility

Future Vision
------

### openpilot Development
We will maintain AI-based openpilot with additional rule-based enhancements to satisfy current users and support the broader openpilot community.

### enhancedpilot Development
We will explore hybrid AI-based + rule-based architecture with expanded hardware capabilities, including radar and LiDAR support, aligning with the evolution of Chinese vehicle sensor technology.
